      <H2>What is an external agent?</H2>
      <P>
        Huabu is a visual interface for the agents you already use. An agent
        harness is the environment that runs your agent and provides its model
        access, tools, and permissions. Connect{' '}
        <DocLink href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents">
          ACP-compatible agents
        </DocLink>{' '}
        on a connected device and choose them through saved Profiles. Huabu
        supplies the Space context, conversation interface, and change review.
        Authentication and usage charges remain with the agent or its provider.
        Built-In Pi is optional, not a prerequisite.
      </P>

      <H2>Access to your Space</H2>
      <P>
        A connected external agent does more than chat. Like Huabu Agent, it can
        read the current Space — its nodes, their content, and layout — and
        change it by creating, editing, connecting, moving, or deleting nodes.
        This access is scoped to the single Space and conversation the agent is
        attached to while that conversation runs; it does not extend to your
        other Spaces.
      </P>
      <Callout tone="info">
        An external agent may ask for your approval before it acts. The request
        appears as a{' '}

        state on its Agent Node. You can also review and undo the changes an
        agent makes, just as you would for Huabu Agent.

        <li>
          <strong>Ensure the connected device can find the agent.</strong> The

          device after installing the agent or changing <Code>PATH</Code>.
          Claude and Codex require their ACP adapters, not only the native CLI.

      <H2>Create a Profile</H2>
      <P>
        A <strong>Profile</strong> is Huabu&apos;s saved connection to one agent
        harness on a connected device, with a launch configuration and working
        directory. Supported agents discovered when a device connects receive
        Profiles automatically; you do not need to create one manually to start
        using them. Discovery does not install agents or sign in for you.

      <P>
        To create another Profile, open Settings (

      <H2>Utility tasks</H2>
      <P>
        A connected external Profile can also handle Huabu-owned background
        tasks such as titles, summaries, keywords, and image labels. Review the
        selection under <strong>Settings &gt; Agent &gt; Utility tasks</strong>.
        If no Utility Agent configuration exists, Huabu selects an available
        external Profile automatically. Existing selections are preserved.

        Utility tasks do not silently fall back to Built-In Pi. The selected

          Before sending the first message in an empty conversation, you can

      <P>
        The <strong>Add agent</strong> entry in either menu opens Settings
        directly on the Agent page. Send a message to begin the conversation.
        Huabu opens the selected Agent when needed and continues using it for
        that conversation. Type <Kbd>/</Kbd> in the message box to see any

        Profile also allows command edits. The device and harness identity are
        fixed; create another Profile to change them. Edits apply to
        conversations that have not started, not already-running sessions.
        Deleting a Profile does not delete its working directory, and later
